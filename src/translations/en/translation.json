You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for you, and that the Company does not provide advice or recommendations regarding any Digital Asset, including their suitability and appropriateness, and investment strategies for any Digital Asset. You agree and understand that you access and use the Platform and the Site at your own risk.",
      "p3": "This brief statement does not disclose all the risks associated with Digital Assets and the use of the Platform. Therefore, you should carefully consider whether such use is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should be aware that you may suffer a total loss of Digital Assets in your Account, and under certain market conditions, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.",
      "h51": "1. Risks related to Digital Assets",
      "p4": "The price and value of any investment in Digital Assets products and any income derived therefrom, if any, can fluctuate and may decrease against you. An individual Digital Assets product may experience downward price movements and, in some circumstances, may even become worth zero. An inherent risk of operating/investing in Digital Assets products is that losses may be incurred rather than gains from the purchase and sale of such products.",
      "p5": "Digital Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by the government or commodities like gold or silver. There is no central bank that can take corrective measures to protect the value of Bitcoin and/or Ether and/or any other Digital Asset in case of crisis or issue more Digital Assets. Instead, Bitcoin, Ether, and any other Digital Asset are autonomous and largely unregulated on global networks. Traders place their trust in a digital, decentralized, and partially anonymous system based on peer-to-peer networks and cryptography to maintain its integrity.",
      "p6": "Transactions in Digital Assets can be irreversible, and as a result, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;",
      "p7": "Some Digital Asset transactions will be deemed complete when they are recorded on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the transaction was initiated;",
      "p8": "The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the ongoing willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or Digital Assets for Digital Assets, which may result in the possibility of a permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset if the market for that Digital Asset disappears; The nature of Digital Assets may lead to a higher risk of fraud or cyber attack and may mean that technological difficulties experienced by the Platform may prevent access to or use of your Digital Assets; Trading Digital Assets is susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could lead to decreased demand relative to supply.",
      "p9": "For example, trust in Bitcoin could collapse due to unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, government crackdowns, the creation of superior alternative cryptocurrencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Trust could also collapse if the system's anonymity is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments can prevent transactions from being settled.",

      "h52": "2. Risks related to derivatives, margin, and borrowing of security/Digital Assets",
      "p12": "Derivative products involve a high degree of risk, often involving leverage, so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying Digital Asset results in a much larger, favorable, or unfavorable movement in the price of the product. If the direction of the trade is opposite to the market's fluctuation, it will result in a significant loss. Depending on the extent of the loss, investors must add margins or reduce positions; otherwise, their positions may be forced to liquidate, and investors must assume all losses caused by this.",
      "p13": "The risk of loss in financing a transaction by depositing security may be significant. You may suffer losses greater than the Digital Assets deposited as security with the Company. You may be required to make additional margin deposits or interest payments in a short period. If the required margin deposit or interest payment is not made within the specified time, your security or positions may be liquidated by the Company at a loss without prior notice. Therefore, you should carefully consider whether such financing arrangement is suitable in light of your financial position and investment objectives.",
      "p14": "When you borrow securities and/or Digital Assets from the Company, you will be required to deposit a required level of collateral. You may be required to make additional deposits in a short period if the collateral level is insufficient relative to the market value of the borrowed assets. If the required deposit is not made within the specified time, the Company may repurchase the borrowed securities and/or Digital Assets without prior notice. When you lend securities and/or Digital Assets to the Company, you temporarily lose legal ownership rights over the lent assets, but in return, you have the right to claim equivalent products.",

The Company's trading facilities are supported by computer systems for order routing, execution, matching, registration, or clearing of transactions. As with all facilities and computer systems, customers will be exposed to risks associated with the systems, including hardware and software failure.

You should also be aware that the Internet is not a completely reliable means of transmission, and there may be delays in service delivery.",

Legislation and tax practice regarding Digital Assets in certain countries may not be clearly established. Therefore, it may be difficult to determine what taxes or how much should be paid in connection with Digital Assets transactions.
